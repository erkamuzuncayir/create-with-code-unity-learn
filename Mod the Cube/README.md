# Hi!
## This is my [Mod the Cube](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/mod-the-cube?labelRequired=true&pathwayId=5f7e17e1edbc2a5ec21a20af&missionId=5f71fe63edbc2a00200e9de0#) study.

In this exercise, I modified a provided script to change the behavior of an object. According to my modified script; our cube can teleport itself to the specific range at random times in random places and change its color randomly at random times.

You can watch preview of the project in below or visit WebGL Build page in [this](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-181332) link.
